["I wanted to love this, but it was pretty expensive for only a few months worth of calendar pages.  I ended up buying a regular weekly planner - 55% OFF! - The Planner - that is 8 1/2 x 11 and has all seven days on the right page and the left page has room to write a To Do List and Goals.  I found this to be more helpful because I could mark each day's eating and sleeping blocks, then also see them side by side - I could see her patterns more easily with a weekly view.  This planner was cute, just not what I wanted.", "I like this log, but think it would work better with clearer AM & PM sections. Each page is 12 hours so you really need two pages a day if your baby feeds or wets a lot in the early morning hours between midnight and 7am. We're cramming those in to the 2 blank spaces above 7am right now.", "My wife and I have a six month old baby boy and around the 4-month mark my wife decided that she would return to work instead of being a stay-at-home mom. We hired an in-home nanny to care for our little boy and the arrangement has worked quite well ever since. Shortly after starting the arrangement we realized that we would need some sort of journal to track our little boy's activities while he was with the nanny and we were working. We used a plain notebook for a period of weeks until we stumbled on the Baby Tracker - Daily Childcare Journal.--------------------LAYOUT AND USE:The Baby Tracker is really an excellent idea. The journal pages are clearly divided into columns for tracking feedings, nap-time, diaper changes, play-time as well as general areas for notes and tracking milestones. The legibility in the Baby Tracker is a huge improvement over our standard notebook entries that really ended up becoming small paragraphs. In a few short moments you can summarize all of the data in the columns in the totals section and determine key information - how much did baby eat, did baby have a bowel movement, how much sleep did they get, etc.There are, however, some frustrating limitations with this journal. First the entire layout is about half a notebook sheet divided down the middle (portrait layout). This constrains entries to very small spaces on each column and row. For much of the information that is okay - feedings can be summarized in ounces; diaper changes by a &#34;#1 or #2&#34; and so on. However, once your baby becomes more active and you'd like to know more than &#34;tummy time&#34; under the play-time column things start to get very tight on the page.Another problem is that this tracker only covers 12 hours out of a baby's day. That's fine if the intention is only to track hours while a baby is with child care providers. However, we really wanted to track our little boy's entire day which often starts much earlier than 6am. Using this journal that would require the use of a second page.--------------------WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(+) Good layout that is easy to read and instantly gather information about your baby's day in a matter of moments(+) High quality paper(+) Consistent quality between the pages--------------------WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE BABY TRACKER:(-) Expensive and gets you at most 6-months, less if you use more than one page for tracking your babies entire day(-) The cover is thick but not a hardback and bends easily in a diaper bag(-) The pages should really be bigger. I understand portability is a concern but the current size is entirely too small--------------------CONCLUSION:I ended up making my own format of this journal in a spreadsheet that includes a 24-hour day and more space for comments along with a few other changes and had the pages bound cheaply at a local shop. This is an adequate journal but expensive for what you get and limitations because of page size.", "I thought keeping a simple handwritten journal would be nice.  But I haven't used this thing at all, and here's why:1.) When you're breastfeeding, it's often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.  If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don't nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You're also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I'd forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I'm not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.  For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training).  It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month (granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction).", 'I think this is an adorable book. The pieces are all attached and each page has a cute activity. Several things though--1. If you sew you can make one that is more directed to your child. And if you sew you will realize this is very over priced.2. Some of the activities are too hard for the age group that would be playing with this book.', "This teether is ridiculous. It's huge, it's hard to clamp down on, and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It's just too big, awkward, and hard to push down on. Not worth the money, in my opinion.", 'I thought my daughter would LOVE this product, but not the case..it is made well..But you have to bite down REALLY hard to make the vibration work :( She does however like the toy at the bottom of it!', "I have a 6.5mo old who loves when we tap on toys when he has them in his mouth, yes sounds weird.  Husband is a drummer and got him obsessed with the tapping even when he is drinking out of his bottle my baby will try to tap the bottle with his hands to feel the vibration.  He has a mini dodge ball and he sticks his face/mouth on the ball and all you have to do is tap the ball and he's a happy baby.  I also bought an infant gum massager electric toothbrush because he was always interested when I brush my teeth.  He loves that as well but has to be supervised so he doesn't choke, you think for long skinny objects made for babies that they would make a guard block to prevent any type of choking.This teether will be better if it had an on/ off button, my baby not able to bite down hard enough to turn it on and once again we have to hold it for him to turn it on.  I was trying to find a teether with vibrations he can use by himself.", "This product sucks. My little boy LOVES to chew on things while he's teething - and he bites down hard. He was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate. Very disappointing.", "My baby liked the massaging action but it took time for him to realize how to do it. When he finally did, the battery gave out nearly the same day. The battery would work in short spurts after a rest but I wouldn't waste my money on it again.", 'I thought this would be great for my teething baby, but the vibration freaks him out.  He wants nothing to do with it.  =(  It might be a wonderful product for other babies, though!  It appears to be well-made.', "My baby hated this thing so I cannot comment on it's effectiveness. Bit it seemed like a cool idea. Passed it on.", 'My friend recommended this teether because her daughter loves it.  However, my daughter loves throwing it on the floor.  Hopefully, it will work better for you.', "Our 6 month old can't bite on this thing hard enough to make it vibrate on his own, so we have to squeeze it and help him hold it in his mouth (it's also heavy).  He seems to enjoy the way it feels, but it's actually so hard to squeeze that even our hands get tired after a minute or so.  Maybe better for older teethers?", 'I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it.  So, when my new baby started teething, I sought out the same teether.  I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is, "safety tested" for BPA, lead, and phthalates.  It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free.  As a former regulator (of medical devices) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements.  Perhaps too much so.  But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear "BPA free" labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn\'t the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I\'m sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I\'m still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?  Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that cannot be confused.', "Don't waste your money, my son would rather suck on his fingers than to use this messaging corn teether.  The massager really has to be squeezed in order to work. :(", "My son has had this teether since he was 3 months old. I thought maybe he's just too young & not interested in it(even though he did have 2 teeth already) He is now 8 months old, and still isn't very interested in this teether. The reason I bought it was because it was in-expensive and easy for him to hold & pick up. He would rather pick up a toy car, or some sort of stuffed toy, which I understand every child is different. My only big complaint - the star bead on the end. It is hard, and pointy. If it catches my son's sore, in-coming teeth the wrong way, he will cry. Other then that, the colors are great, and definitely catch baby's eye. Overall, it's an OK toy for the price.", "This would have been an ok teething necklace if it weren't for the Star bead. As another reviewer pointed out, if your child chews on the pointy edge of the star it can be very painful. I have thrown this necklace out after having to pull off the road last week when my child screamed suddenly in the back of the car and was then crying hysterically.", "I really wanted to love this sling.  I had seen several mothers use these before, and the nurse in our childbirth class raved about it.  I was so excited when I received it as a gift.I started using this with my son when he was just a week old. I put him in the cradle position, but I was so afraid he was going to sufficate on the fabric around him, I had to keep my hand in the sling next to his face.As he got older, it did get easier to use.  It was good to use while in the grocery store.  However, it pulled hard on my shoulder.Now, he's 7 months old, and he's crawling and pulling himself up, and he doesn't like to be restrained at all.  I've tried the kangaroo position, but I'm so scared he's going to fall out the bottom because he is quite a wiggle worm.  The last time I used this, the shoulder strap got so close to my neck that it started to interfere with my circulation.I'm glad I had this for the grocery store, but I think with my next child, I'm going to have to rethink what kind of carrier I use.", "I bought this because of all the wonderful things I heard about slings.  I even practiced with my cat before to see if I could put it on and if it was comfortable.  I must admit this is so much more comfortable than the front packs or back packs.  It doesn't cut across the back like the front packs can.  However, my daughter will not go in this.  I had tried from day one to carry her in this.  She screams.  My child hardly ever cries and when I say she screams, I mean turns red and screams.  As soon as I take her out she is fine.  Now that she is older I can carry her like a front pack, but quite honestly, the front pack is just easier.  I wanted to use the sling because I nurse and I should have been able to nurse her while we were out.  She just will not lay in it.  My friend has this and loves it.  Her baby cooperates.  She has carried him in it since she brought him home from the hospital.  She can nurse him while walking.  When my daughter gets older I plan on using it to carry her on my hip.  I watched the video and you can use it to help with back support while you carry your child on your hip.  I hope I can use it like that, but for the next baby, I am not going to use it.  I will stick with the traditional front pack.  These slings are just not very easy on larger women who are a rather endowed.", "I purchased a total of 4 of these, thinking I needed to change the bedding constantly due to spit up.The instructions said to hang dry only so I thought I needed more to get through the week.  It turns out I can just toss it in the dryer and put it right back on the mattress.Had I known I didn't need to hang dry, I wouldn't have purchased any extra and just went with the 2 they gave me when I purchased the cosleeper.The material is average, nothing special.  It holds up well to lots of washes and uses.", 'The shipping was quick. The colors are pretty but the sheets themselves are not soft. That was disappointing to my daughter who I bought the sheets for and of course to me. They are not inexpensive so I expected more. I purchased five sheets to go with the co-sleeper I bought her for their first baby. We have not assembled the co-sleeper yet but when I received it the box was all torn and dented. Looking at it the contents looks okay, but we will see when the my son in law puts it together.', "I just bought this toy because it was the only one I could find in the store for a stroller.. And of course it won't fit on our Graco stroller.", 'Baby loved this but the only problem is the straps that tie it to the stroller are not big enough for some trays. Due to this my first one came un-sewed and I had to buy another one and the same thing happened again.', "I received this as a gift, unforutnately it didn't fit on our stroller (pretty standard Graco Travel System) or on our carseat (either our Grace or our Marathon) and so it was pretty useless.", "We have/had a Graco Quattro and a MetroLite stroller and This doesn't fit on either one!!  It was a complete waste of money! Try it in the store on a stroller like you own before buying!", "I bought this primarily because it takes regular trash bags, we used it the way it's supposed to be used for the first couple of days but quickly discovered that as the pail gets full the dropping mechanism gets stuck forcing you to clean out the mechanism whenever it's time to change the pail, and it's one more thing to wipe down if a diaper gets too messy.  Also, my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper.  Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in, this allows me to keep tabs on how full it's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism wouldn't have allowed... and still trap the smell!  Of course this negates the cool mechanism and makes it a plastic trash can with a tight lid, something I could have bought for cheaper.", "This product isn't that bad... however it is not smell proof.  I love the fact that it will take any type of trash bag, but if you do not empty the pail out daily the smell leaks out into your baby's room and it does not smell pleasant.", 'I truly believe this is the best diaper pail on the market...  It\'s simple to use, can take any garbage bag, and does a fantastic job of containing odors.  BUT, my complaint is -- why couldn\'t they make it bigger?I\'ve heard it\'s the biggest one you can buy, but I find it frustrating that my regular kitchen-sized garbage bags are only 2/3 full when the Diaper Champ requires us to remove the bag.  It\'s wasteful!  (I know the simple solution is to buy smaller bags, but I feel the product should accomodate the most common household garbage bag -- the "tall kitchen bags" -- and do it efficiently.  The whole point of getting the Diaper Champ was so that we wouldn\'t have to buy separate bags for it!)', 'This is easy to use, but it does not disguise the smell that great!  I did like that you can use any kind of bag with it.', "I have no doubt that my wife and I will be happy with the Diaper Champ (our first baby is due in two weeks).  But we have had to expend quite the effort to find one that actually works.  The first Diaper Champ that we bought had a  piston that would not drop (the plastic joint did not meet and thus caught the piston on its way down).  The replacement Diaper Champ's piston moved just fine but the drum would not flip over easily.  It took two hands and a foot securing the bottom of the can to the floor to get the drum to turn.  This is not one handed operation as the box states.  After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works.  And you do not even need to ask.  Yes, it was made in China.", "This contains the smell and it uses regular bags which makes it the best product in its category.  However, I never use it.  It's so much easier just to throw the soiled diaper in a regular garbage bag and take the trash out often.  We take ours out daily - this product tends to make you lazy and by the time you fill it - YUCK!Save your money and just throw your diapers in the trash.", 'After reading all the reviews on-line for this product I chose to register for it, now that I am using it I am disappointed.  I\'m not sure if my sense of smell is just that of super hero\'s or my daughter has super smelly diapers.  Either way her room does have the smell of dirty diapers when you enter and the "Champ" is in the back corner of the room.  I guess I\'m just grateful that the whole house doesn\'t smell as bad as her room.', "You can't put poopie diapers in this pail, it doesn't hold the smell back at all.  I use it for the wet diapers and it's fine.  I use the scented bags for the poopie diapers and throw them away in my regular garabage that gets taken out every day.  Opening the pail to empty the bag is a little difficult, but it's better than having to buy special bags for it.  The big blue round part on the side broke off for some reason and it wouldn't go back on.  I ended up using masking tape to hold it on.  It serves it's purpose, but I'm not thrilled with it.", "I love the fact that you don't need a specific bag, and a cheap garbage bag is enough. But it doesn't keep smells in at all. I didn't realize I was buying a large one either, so even though it's far from full you have to take the gab out. But it's just the nature of garbage.", 'Ok, so the idea of the Diaper Champ is awesome--it is very easy to use--that\'s why I gave it 1 star. However...the thing REALLY stinks!! Someone gave me the Neat diaper disposal system for my baby shower & I absolutely loved it. However, the handle broke on it just 2 weeks ago. I thought..."Maybe I could try the Diaper Champ since I won\'t have to purchase any liners"...Well that was a HUGE mistake!! I see why this thing got 4 stars--all of these parents have young children!! My daughter is 14 months old & because she is older, I guess her diapers come with more odor! After literally only a few diapers, her entire room smelled of poop! I couldn\'t stand it! In one week, I changed the garbage bag at least 4 times. Is that really saving money?? I don\'t think so! Plus her room really smelled bad. I\'m taking it back & getting the Neat again! The Diaper Champ must be great for infants, but you may want to consider something else for older babies!', "We got this and the Diaper Decor Plus as gifts and I have to say that the Champ is not my favorite. I like that you can use your own garbage bags with the Champ, but that's the only positive in my opinion. I find it pretty hard to open it without breaking a nail and it does get fill up much more quickly than the Decor. When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier. I also like the Decor because you can dispose of the diaper with your foot, instead of a hand like with the Champ, because now that my son is super squirmy on the changing table, I need of my hands on him!", 'I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.  For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.  The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.  All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.', "It does contain most of the odors but not all.  It is however a huge hassle to open so beware if you value your manicures.  It will save you money on refills so that's a plus.", "I was quite pleased with this for the first 6 months. Now as my son's diet is changing, the odor of his bowl movements can no longer be contained. We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain. There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes). The problem is if the diaper bag gets too full it makes it really hard to pull out the diapers.Pros:- cheaper than alternatives- worked great the first 6 months- was able to use normal garbage bagsCons:- smells after 6 months- bad tapered design makes it hard to remove diapers", "After reading the glowing reviews here and receiving a positive one from a friend, we decided to replace a broken Diaper Genie (lid broke off) with the Champ.  What a disappointment!  Here are the big two complaints:1.  It's unsanitary.  Putting diapers and messy wipes into the slot and dumping them in the bucket leaves the slot a germy mess.  Having to clean the slot each and every time is just unrealistic and too much work!  And I fear our toddler getting anywhere near the thing because of the germs.2.  The smell.  It's probably not as bad with an infant, but let me tell you, opening the lid to empty toddler diapers is one frightening experience!  Yikes, what a smell after just a couple days.  We used the odor prevention garbage bags, but nothing prepared me for that odor when I opened the lid.  Since nothing seals off the individual diapers, it's just a sea of messy diapers in there.  Yuck.On the plus side, it's wonderful to be able to use regular garbage bags, not the expensive ones the Genie requires.  And it's certainly easy to use.  But I'm not sure how this product is any better than just using a garbage can with a lid.When our second child arrives next year, we'll be going back to the Diaper Genie.  It's not perfect, but it's much cleaner and there's less odor involved (the reason to get one of these products in the first place).  And the new version of the Genie is much easier to operate than the earlier model, so we'll just cross our fingers the lid stays attached next time.", "I've been over to friends' houses and fought with their diaper genies. I decided to go with the Diaper Champ instead, because you can use regular trash bags with it (much less expensive than the Genie refills).I had no complaints, until it got really warm in my daughter's room and then the smell appeared.  I've tried Lysol and the dryer sheet at the bottom of the can and various other tricks to mask the odor emanating from the Champ without luck.  Baby is breast-fed too.  I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids.  Ick.I'm wondering if fighting with the Genie and buying refills is a better option for us, as we don't have air-conditioning and it will get warm in the room this summer!I will say this though, other reviewers have complained that the bag is not completely full when the Champ seems to need a change, but I find this convenient, as I don't have to drag out an extremely heavy bag.", "......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star..... Please don't buy this one!", "When my hand-me-down Diaper Genie broke, I bought a Diaper Champ. I figured I'd save some money not having to buy the Diaper Genie refills. While I was happy about being able to use regular trash bags, that was all that really impressed me with the Diaper Champ.The odor protection of the Diaper Champ really leaves something to be desired. My son's room smelled very badly, even when I changed the pail every day.Changing the Diaper Champ really isn't a pleasant experience. Not only does the odor of multiple nasty diapers spew forth (nothing is sealed) when you open the lid to change the trash bag, but the trash bag is somewhat difficult to position correctly.Well, I'm back to using a Diaper Genie, and my son's room smells just fine. Save your money and buy something other than the Diaper Champ the first time around.", "I'm not sure about this one.  In concept, it's a fabulous idea.  I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.  I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.  The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.  In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.  My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor...I'm concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse.  If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.", "My husband and I hated this diaper pail from the day we first began using it.  The cylinder continually got stuck, and diapers would often get stuck in the cylinder.  It is no fun pulling apart a diaper pail at 2:00 in the morning because the handle won't go down due to a diaper that is stuck in it.  Plus, I think it is unsanitary.  The diapers are placed in a plastic hole at the top of the pail, and then they drop through to the bag.  Well, messy diapers sometimes left a bit of a mess in the opening area, and it was not easy to clean.  Finally, after two months of dealing with this pail, one morning, I flipped the handle, and the cylinder fell right into the bottom of the pail.  (It was not a pleasant task to retrieve it, either!)  I haven't been able to figure out how to fix it, so we are using a Safety 1st Diaper Pail now, and the Diaper Champ will be hauled to the road for the trash pickup next week.  I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.  I do not recommend this product.", "We got this for our newborn, and within the first two weeks of use, the liner (that I assume is supposed to keep odor in) fell out because it got caught on one of the stickies on the diaper. This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.", "Our son uses the babi italia pinehurst classic crib...bought the ultimate crib sheet for it but it doesn't fit the crib very well. It is good for backup use if my other regular sheets are in the wash though. It just has problems fitting around the big 4 corner crib rails so I am forced to attach the snaps on the regular rails instead which makes the sheet not be able to stretch to look completely flat.Today I just found another use out of it though after feeling that it was a waste to buy this. My son has been pulling up to stand and teething on the top side rails and actually made teeth marks with paint coming off! AH!  So I improvised and used this crib sheet to cover the top rail, it fit perfectly in length and snaps perfectly together to stay on.  It would have cost about the same price to buy an actual[...] rail cover so it works out.  He usually only teethes on 1 side too!", "I bought this based on good reviews in the Baby Bargains book, so I had high expectations. It does make it somewhat easier to change sheets in the middle of the night, but you still have to unsnap it from about 10 places on the crib to do so; I've also found the snaps a little difficult to engage. If you're not using crib bumpers, the look of all the elastic pieces on the crib slats isn't too attractive. I'm glad to have one of these, but it isn't the miracle sheet I hoped for.", "I found the ultimate crib sheet to be much more trouble than it's worth. Lifting my daughter's mattress takes no effort: it's made of  lightweight foam. As a result, changing her sheets is also super easy. I just have to lift the mattress, and it takes two seconds. On the other hand, snapping all the ties on the ultimate crib sheet takes bending over the crib for five solid minutes (plus, the manufacturer recommends snapping the snaps before every wash, which means snap on crib, unsnap, snap again before wash, unsnap, snap on crib...) So, if you have a foam mattress in a corner of the room, I'd suggest just getting normal sheets and some of those stay-dry liners. If you have a coil mattress and keep the crib in the center of the room, then by all means, try the ultimate crib sheet..."]
